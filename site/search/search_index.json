Buying NFTs You can instantly buy NFTs from a bonding curve or make a collection offer for a seller to accept. How do you buy an NFT? Go to the collections page and select a collection. Select the NFTs you want to buy to add them to the cart: Click \"> sudo swap\" to initiate the swap in your wallet. How do you make a collection offer? Go to the collections page and select a collection. Click \"Make Collection Offer\" to open the offer manager window: Enter the start price Selling NFTs You can instantly sell NFTs to a bonding curve or make a listing for a buyer to take. How do you sell an NFT? Go to the Collections page and select a collection. Navigate to the \"Sell\" tab at the center of the page: Select the NFTs you want to sell and click \"> sudo swap\". Give sudoswap access to the NFTs by confirming the first transaction in your wallet. Finalize the sale by confirming the second transaction in your wallet. How do you list an NFT? Navigate to the \"Your NFTs\" page on the top right. Select the NFTs you want to list and click \"List NFTs\" at the bottom of the page: Under \"Start Price\", enter your desired price. Optionally, if listing multiple NFTs, enter a \"Price Increase\" by which the price of all remaining items will be incremented each time an item is sold: Click \"List NFTs\". Give sudoswap access to the NFTs by confirming the first transaction in your wallet. Finalize the listing by confirming the second transaction in your wallet. What's the difference between selling and listing? When you sell an NFT on sudoswap, it is immediately sold into a bonding curve for the best price possible. This means that you receive the proceeds of the sale right away. When you list an NFT on sudoswap, you can set whatever price you want, but you have to wait until someone buys it from you. If you want to get instant liquidity for your NFTs, you should consider selling them. However, because of the way bonding curves work, you'll some experience slippage, meaning that you get slightly less than market value for your NFTs. Slippage gets worse the more NFTs you sell from a collection, or the lower that collection's liqudity. If you aren't satisfied with the prices you can get for selling, you should list the NFTs and wait for someone to buy them. Providing liquidity Anyone can provide liquidity on sudoswap. You can choose whether you want to buy or sell NFTs across a range of prices \u2013 a bonding curve \u2013 or do both to earn trading fees. What is a pool? A pool, or liquidity pool, is a smart contract that allows you to instantly swap between two assets. On sudoswap, the most common type of pool is an NFT<>ETH pool, which means that anyone holding NFTs from that collection can instantly swap them for ETH, or vice versa. Pools use a bonding curve to determine the relative price at which one asset is traded for another. The more an asset is bought from the pool, the more expensive it becomes. Conversely, the more an asset is sold to the pool, the cheaper it becomes. Ideally, a pool contains some amount of both assets, enabling users to swap back and forth between them. However, it's also possible to create a pool with just one asset, meaning that users will only be able to buy that asset from the pool. Types of bonding curve Sudoswap allows liqudity providers to choose from two types of bonding curve: linear and exponential curves. Depending on which type of bonding curve a pool uses, the price will be adjusted differently when an asset is bought from or sold to the pool. Linear curve With a linear bonding curve, the price of an NFT is increased by a flat amount (called delta ) every time an item is bought from the pool. Conversely, the price of the NFT is decreased by that same flat amount every time an item is sold to the pool. For example, a liqudity provider may create an NFT<>ETH pool with a Start Price of 1 ETH and a delta of 0.1 ETH. Assuming they provide enough liquidity, the price of an NFT will increase to 1.1 ETH after one item is purchased from the pool. After a second item is purchased, the price will increase to 1.2 ETH, and so on and so forth. At any point, if an NFT is sold to the pool, the price will decrease by 0.1 ETH. Exponential curve With an exponential bonding curve, the price of an NFT is increased by a certain percentage (also called delta ) every time an item is bought from the pool. Conversely, the price of the NFT is decreased equivalently every time an item is sold to the pool. To calculate the equivalent decrease, convert the the percentage to a decimal index (e.g. for 50%, the index would be 1.5) and divide the price by this number. For example, a liqudity provider may create an NFT<>ETH pool with a Start Price of 2 ETH and a delta of 50%. Assuming they provide enough liquidity, the price of an NFT will increase to 2 + 50% = 3 ETH after one item is purchased from the pool. After a second item is purchased, the price will increase to 3 + 50% = 4.5 ETH, and so on and so forth. At any point, if an NFT is sold to the pool, the price will be divided by 1.5. How do you create a pool? To create a pool, start by navigating to the Your Pools tab at the top-right of the page. Click on \"+ Create New Pool\" and follow the instructions below depending on the type of pool you want to create. Buy NFTs with ETH Click on the deposit drop-down box and select ETH: Click on the receive drop-down box and select the NFT collection you want to buy. If you don't see the collection you want to buy, paste the contract address into the search bar, click \"Add\", and then select the collection. Enter the start price you want to pay, choose the type of bonding curve, and enter your chosen delta. If you are only buying one item, choose either type of curve and enter any delta: Type in how many NFTs you want to buy and click \"Next Step >\". Note: The slider on the right hand side is only for visualization purposes and does not affect your pool. Confirm the details of your pool are correct, click \"Create Pool\", and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Sell NFTs for ETH Click on the deposit drop-down box and select the NFT collection you want to sell: Click on the receive drop-down box and select ETH. Enter the start price you want to receive, choose the type of bonding curve, and enter your chosen delta. If you are only selling one item, choose either type of curve and enter any delta: Type in how many NFTs you want to sell and click \"Next Step >\". Note: The slider on the right hand side is only for visualization purposes and does not affect your pool. Confirm the details of your pool are correct and select the NFTs you want to deposit: Click \"Approve\" and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

Click on the \"Edit\" button at the top-right of the pool: Enter a new start price and delta for the pool: Click \"Update\" and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Note: At this time it is not possible to convert a linear pool into an exponential pool or vice versa. To do this, you must withdraw your assets from the existing pool and create a new one. How do you deposit NFTs into a pool? Navigate to the Your Pools tab at the top-right of the page. Click on the pool you want to deposit to. Click on the \"Deposit\" button at the top-left of the pool. Select the NFTs you want to deposit: Click \"Deposit NFTs\" and confirm the transaction in your wallet. How do you withdraw NFTs from a pool? Navigate to the Your Pools tab at the top-right of the page. Click on the pool you want to withdrawm from. Click on the \"Withdraw\" button at the top-left of the pool. Select the NFTs you want to withdraw: Click \"Withdraw NFTs\" and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Do I get a token representing my liquidity position? No, you will not receive a token representing your liquidity position when creating a new pool. This is because every liquidity pool has a unique smart contract associated with and owned by its creator. All assets pertaining to a pool are held in the pool's smart contract, so there is no need for additional tokens to keep track of deposits.","title":"User Guide"},{"location":"guide/#user-guide","text":"This guide demonstrates how to buy and sell NFTs on sudoswap, as well as how to create and modify your own liquidity pools.","title":"User Guide"},{"location":"guide/#buying-nfts","text":"You can instantly buy NFTs from a bonding curve or make a collection offer for a seller to accept.","title":"Buying NFTs"},{"location":"guide/#how-do-you-buy-an-nft","text":"Go to the collections page and select a collection.

At present, there are two choices: LinearCurve and ExponentialCurve . Both curves are parameterized by one variable, delta , which is set in the pair itself. More bonding curve contracts can be whitelisted in the future for use with LSSVMPairFactory . After a user trades with a pair, the pair consults its bonding curve to determine what its new price should be. Technical note: the bonding curves are intended to be pure, i.e. they do not modify the state of pairs that call them. The actual logic for input/output validation and price updating happens in the LSSVMPair contract itself. Linear Curve The linear curve performs an additive operation to update the price. delta is assumed to be set properly by the LP to be the same precision of the pair's underlying token. If the pair has just sold an NFT by giving out an NFT and receiving tokens, the next price it will quote to sell NFTs at will be delta more. Conversely, if the pair has just bought an NFT by giving out tokens and receiving an NFT, the next price it will quote to purchase NFTs at will be delta less. Exponential Curve The exponential curve performs a multiplicative operation. delta is treated as a multiplier assuming a fixed point system where 1e18 is 1. For example, if delta is 1e18 + 1e17 , this represents a 10% change in price each time. If the pair has just sold an NFT by giving out an NFT and receiving tokens, the next price it will quote to sell NFTs at will be multiplicatively delta more. Conversely, if the pair has just bought an NFT by giving out tokens and receiving an NFT, the next price it will quote to purchase NFTs at will be multiplicatively delta less. Understanding Spot Price In addition to modifying delta to change the pair's price reactivity, it is important to understand how the spotPrice variable in LSSVMPair behaves. The spot price refers to the instantaneous price of selling 1 NFT to the pair. The instantaneous price of buying 1 NFT from the pair is set to be the spotPrice adjusted upwards by 1 unit of delta with respect to the pair's bonding curve. For example, say that we have a Trade LSSVMPair for ETH with a spotPrice of 1 ETH, and a linear curve with a delta of 0.1 ETH. (Assume fee is 0.) Then a user selling 1 NFT to the pair would receive 1 ETH, whereas a user purchasing 1 NFT from the pair would have to send (1 + 0.1) = 1.1 ETH. In other words, the price to purchase an NFT from a pair will always be delta greater (either additively on multiplicatively) than the price to sell an NFT to the pair. Pair managers who are manually adjusting spotPrice should keep this in mind. (Note that for simplicity, some examples in this documentation may use \"spot price\" to also refer to the instantaneous buy price.) Pricing For Multi-Swaps If a user buys or sells multiple NFTs in one swap transaction, the spotPrice will update by delta for each NFT bought or sold. For example, say that we have a Trade LSSVMPair for ETH with a spotPrice of 1 ETH, and a linear curve with a delta of 0.1 ETH. (Assume fee is 0.) If a user sells 5 NFTs to this pair, they will receive: 1 ETH for the first NFT 0.9 ETH for the second NFT 0.8 ETH for the third NFT 0.7 ETH for the fourth NFT 0.6 ETH for the fifth NFT At the end of the multi-swap, the new spotPrice will be set to 0.5 ETH.","title":"Bonding Curves and Pricing"},{"location":"pricing/#bonding-curves-and-pricing","text":"To determine pricing, each LSSVMPair is associated with a specific bonding curve set by the LP. At present, there are two choices: LinearCurve and ExponentialCurve . Both curves are parameterized by one variable, delta , which is set in the pair itself. More bonding curve contracts can be whitelisted in the future for use with LSSVMPairFactory . After a user trades with a pair, the pair consults its bonding curve to determine what its new price should be. Technical note: the bonding curves are intended to be pure, i.e. they do not modify the state of pairs that call them. The actual logic for input/output validation and price updating happens in the LSSVMPair contract itself.","title":"Bonding Curves and Pricing"},{"location":"pricing/#linear-curve","text":"The linear curve performs an additive operation to update the price. delta is assumed to be set properly by the LP to be the same precision of the pair's underlying token. If the pair has just sold an NFT by giving out an NFT and receiving tokens, the next price it will quote to sell NFTs at will be delta more. Conversely, if the pair has just bought an NFT by giving out tokens and receiving an NFT, the next price it will quote to purchase NFTs at will be delta less.","title":"Linear Curve"},{"location":"pricing/#exponential-curve","text":"The exponential curve performs a multiplicative operation. delta is treated as a multiplier assuming a fixed point system where 1e18 is 1. For example, if delta is 1e18 + 1e17 , this represents a 10% change in price each time. If the pair has just sold an NFT by giving out an NFT and receiving tokens, the next price it will quote to sell NFTs at will be multiplicatively delta more. Conversely, if the pair has just bought an NFT by giving out tokens and receiving an NFT, the next price it will quote to purchase NFTs at will be multiplicatively delta less.","title":"Exponential Curve"},{"location":"pricing/#understanding-spot-price","text":"In addition to modifying delta to change the pair's price reactivity, it is important to understand how the spotPrice variable in LSSVMPair behaves. The spot price refers to the instantaneous price of selling 1 NFT to the pair. The instantaneous price of buying 1 NFT from the pair is set to be the spotPrice adjusted upwards by 1 unit of delta with respect to the pair's bonding curve. For example, say that we have a Trade LSSVMPair for ETH with a spotPrice of 1 ETH, and a linear curve with a delta of 0.1 ETH. (Assume fee is 0.) Then a user selling 1 NFT to the pair would receive 1 ETH, whereas a user purchasing 1 NFT from the pair would have to send (1 + 0.1) = 1.1 ETH. In other words, the price to purchase an NFT from a pair will always be delta greater (either additively on multiplicatively) than the price to sell an NFT to the pair. Pair managers who are manually adjusting spotPrice should keep this in mind.

Users can set allowances for tokens and NFTs once for the router, instead of for each new pool they wish to swap with. On the protocol level, the sudoswap AMM does not perform any routing optimization on-chain. Users are expected to know their desired swap paths when calling the router, e.g. via the use of an off-chain indexing service. NFT<>Token Swaps When swapping tokens for NFTs, users can either specify which NFT IDs they want from each pair, or they can ask for any ID from the pair. When swapping from NFT to tokens or from tokens to NFTs, the LSSVMRouter has two types of swaps: a Normal Swap and a Robust Swap. Normal Swap A Normal Swap is conceptually similar to token-to-token swaps on other DEXs. The user sends the router a maximum input amount or minimum output amount (i.e. allowed slippage), as well as a swap route and a deadline. The router will then swap across the various pairs specified. At the end of all the swaps, the router will total all tokens to be received or sent, and revert if the total is beyond the user's specified slippage. Robust Swap In contrast, a Robust Swap does a slippage check per swap pair rather than an aggregate check at the end. If the price for a specified swap pair is past the allowable slippage, the router will silently skip that route and move on to the next one, with no reverts or errors. This is intended for situations where the price can move quickly between your transaction submission and execution. Normal vs Robust Swap To see the difference between these swap types, consider this example: say there are 2 pairs for NFT and ETH. The first pair has a spot price of 1 ETH and a linear curve with a delta of 0.1 ETH. The second pair has a spot price of 1 ETH and a linear curve with a delta of 1 ETH. A user wishes to purchase NFTs, one from each pool for 1 ETH each, with 10% slippage. The user submits a swap transaction. Before this transaction is executed, someone else goes and buys 1 NFT from each pool for 1 ETH each. The new spot price for the first pair is 1.1 ETH, and for the second pair is 2 ETH. If the user had submitted a Normal Swap, they would have sent 2.2 ETH (2 ETH + 0.2 ETH to cover the additional 10% slippage), and the transaction would fail, as they would have sent enough ETH to cover the first swap at the new price of 1.1 ETH, but not enough to cover the second swap at 2 ETH. In contrast, if the user had submitted a Robust Swap, they would have also sent 2.2 ETH, but with a per-swap max cost of 1.1 ETH. The router would have enough to cover the first swap at 1.1 ETH. Then, upon seeing the second swap would cost 2 ETH, the router would skip this pair entirely. The transaction would succeed, refunding 1.1 ETH back to the user, as well as sending them the one NFT they purchased for 1.1 ETH. Thus, the Robust Swap is generally recommended for a better user experience in higher volatility environments, at the cost of slightly more gas.
