# Frequently Asked Questions

This page contains some of the most frequently asked questions among NFT collection owners.

### How do I set the name/ticker for my collection?

Sudoswap automatically pulls the name and ticker for your NFT collection from the NFT smart contract itself.

### How do I set the icon/header image for my collection?

Sudoswap automatically pulls the icon and header image for your NFT collection from OpenSea.

### Why isn't my collection showing in the search bar?

For a collection to show up in the search bar, it must have at least one liquidity pool or past volume on sudoswap. If your collection only recently met this requirement, please allow some time for sudoswap to process this.
