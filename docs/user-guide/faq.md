# Frequently Asked Questions

This page contains some of the most frequently asked questions among sudoswap users.

### Can I withdraw airdropped tokens from my pool?

Yes. At any time, you can withdraw any ERC20, ERC721, or ERC1155 tokens from your liqudity pools using the "Withdraw Other Tokens" feature on the pool's page. Note that you can only withdraw tokens from pools you have created.

### What's the difference between selling and listing?

When you *sell* an NFT on sudoswap, it is immediately sold into a [bonding curve](https://docs.sudoswap.xyz/pricing/) for the best price possible. This means that you receive the proceeds of the sale right away.

When you *list* an NFT on sudoswap, you can set whatever price you want, but you have to wait until someone buys it from you.

### Do I get a token representing my liquidity position?

No, you will not receive a token representing your liquidity position when creating a new pool. This is because every liquidity pool has a unique smart contract associated with and owned by its creator.

All assets pertaining to a pool are held in the pool's smart contract, so there is no need for additional tokens to keep track of deposits.

### Why is my new liquidity pool not showing up on the sudoswap website?

Sudoswap indexes on-chain data at regular intervals. If a new liquidity pool is not showing up, it is usually because sudoswap has not yet had a chance to index the pool's creation. Please check again at a later time.

### What happens to a trade pool when one side of the pool is depleted?

Trade pools remain trade pools even if one side of the pool is depleted. Nevertheless, pools can only fulfill buys and sells if they hold the necessary assets to do so.
